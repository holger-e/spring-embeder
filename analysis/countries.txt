Only 5 components contain edges from more than one country:
comp0.txt => 1816 vertices, ?? countries
comp3.txt => 36 vertices, 3 countries
comp35.txt => 4 vertices, 2 countries
comp43.txt => 8 vertices, 1 country + 1 empty (probably also Switzerland)
comp62.txt => 4 vertices, 2 countries
comp71.txt => 6 vertices, 2 countries + 1 empty (probably also Switzerland or
  France)

Open Questions:
1) In total only 20 countries are missing, maybe these can be googled.
2) How is the country distribution in comp0.txt? Create "country graph" and look
   at its topology, hopefully very easy.
